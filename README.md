# Chemical-composition-and-UTS-of-low-carbon-low-alloy-steels
Description:
This dataset contains the experimental data on the elemental composition and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 44,373 samples of low alloy steels. The samples were produced and tested within an industrial steel manufacturing environment. The data were collected as part of a research project investigating the relationship between chemical composition and mechanical properties, particularly UTS.
